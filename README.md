# TestToadz

TestToadz - ERC-721 NFT Testnet Faucets

Inspired by this Git repository [TestToadz](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/TestToadz)

Due to the closure of some test networks, it is recommended to deploy test contracts on new test networks and additional networks to facilitate testing.

The SameToadz smart contract at [0x07e5ce0f8f](https://etherscan.io/address/0x07e5ce0f8fa46031a1dcc8cb2530f0a52019830d#code) has been renamed to [TestToadz](contracts/TestToadz.sol), compiled with [OpenZeppelin v4.9.0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.9.0) and deployed on the following testnets:
